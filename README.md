Project Summary
  This application allows the user to create a list of upcoming releases they are interested in. It works similar to a calendar, but somewhat different. Let's say I want to buy a DVD that's being released on March 2nd. If I add that event on a calendar, but don't have a chance to buy the DVD until a month later, there's a chance I might forget that it came out. If I add that DVD release to ReleaseTracker, it will stay in my "Newly Released" list until I've bought the DVD and/or removed it from my list. The application also shows a list of upcoming events that the user has saved in the "Upcoming Releases" list.
